# Ask Me Anything-ish 🙋🏻‍♀️
Since attending Brainstation back in 2016, I've had bright-eyed bootcamp developers and professionals transitioning in their careers ask me to coffee to get my insights into bootcamp. Those coffees can range anywhere between 30-minutes to 3-hours. (No really, 3 hours at bubble tea!) I sincerely enjoy those coffees but I unfortunately can't clone myself (darn, I don't live in a sci-fi fantasy movie?) to go to coffee with everyone! ☕

Hence, this AMA. I hope to provide an accessible document of frequently asked questions re: bootcamp 💻

If what you're looking for isn't here, please submit a Github issue and I will get back to you (within reason)! 😬

## Which bootcamp did you go to?

## Which bootcamp do you recommend (for Canadians)?

## Is a bootcamp worth it?

## How much can you realistically make after a bootcamp?

## How long did it take you to get a job after your bootcamp?

## What made you stand out as a bootcamp grad?

## What should I do to increase my chances of getting hired?
