# Ask Me Anything-ish üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Since attending Brainstation back in 2016, I've had bright-eyed bootcamp developers and professionals transitioning in their careers ask me to coffee to get my insights into bootcamp. Those coffees can range anywhere between 30-minutes to 3-hours. (No really, 3 hours at bubble tea!) I sincerely enjoy those coffees but I unfortunately can't clone myself (darn, I don't live in a sci-fi fantasy movie?) to go to coffee with everyone! ‚òï

Hence, this AMA. I hope to provide an accessible document of frequently asked questions re: bootcamp üíª

If what you're looking for isn't here, please submit a Github issue and I will get back to you (within reason)! üò¨

And if this AMA was helpful for you, consider [sending a virtual coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/clearlythuydoan) as a token of appreciation ‚òï‚ù§Ô∏è

## Which bootcamp did you go to?
I went to [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/) in Toronto.

## Which bootcamp do you recommend?
It depends on what you're looking for. 

There's a number of them in Toronto itself: [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/), [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/), [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/toronto?&topic=&mkt_account_id=1056949875&mkt_campaign_id=2016666190&mkt_ad_group_id=70434038294&mkt_device_type=c&mkt_keyword=general%20assembly%20coding%20bootcamp&mkt_matchtype=e&mkt_placement=&mkt_ad_id=524364735019&mkt_network=g&mkt_target_id=kwd-865210816442&mkt_feed_item_id=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search-bra&utm_campaign=TS:TX:BRA:TOR:BR:GeneralAssembly&utm_content=campus-lead-lander&utm_term=general%20assembly%20coding%20bootcamp&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu_oS040NM_ZI-lfskdkWKU0hTHKPmnacVmY0hqTFWjdL86qVM2jdG8aAveQEALw_wcB), [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu9CiMljl0pNBmz9S_xOkzclqxTWPlnB58sxWp62Qqe6kBf52Zh4w94aAkvzEALw_wcB), and even the [University of Toronto](https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/coding/online/landing/?s=Google-Unbranded_RFull_&msg_cv_scta=4&msg_cv_stbn=1&msg_cv_fcta=1&pkw=%2Bcoding%20%2Bacademy&pcrid=464423316879&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-TORONTO%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7CONL%7C_RFull_%7CALL%7CNBD-G%7CBMM%7CCore%7CSkills&utm_term=%2Bcoding%20%2Bacademy&s=google&k=%2Bcoding%20%2Bacademy&utm_adgroupid=107034141817&utm_locationphysicalms=9000858&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=464423316879&utm_placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu8__bP9BPUxOGRwygzA9hugmrHOJRXEfcNWHT8rUDF-TrdnbUO8MgwaAu_XEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). 

In the US and UK, I've heard about [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) and [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), though there's probably a bunch more.

Some factors to consider are the curriculum offered compared to your desired job market, tuition cost and availbility of payment plans, job support, networking opportunities, and other skills developed outside of coding. Download the curricula for each bootcamp and compare them.

## Is a bootcamp worth it?

It depends on your timeline, budget, and learning style. For me, I had gotten permanently laid off from my social media manager position at an advertising compmany. I wanted to return to the job market competitively and figured I would need to gain a new skill to do so. Around this time I found out about Brainstation via an Instagram ad, IIRC. I knew I didn't want to go back to a traditional school. No 2-4 years just to get a diploma or a degree for me. I wanted to be job-market ready ASAP. Even 1 year wasn't going to cut it for me. Because a bootcamp is a condensed, accelerated curriculum designed to get you ready as soon as possible, that was a fit for me. However, having the budget, understanding that you aren't guaranteed a job after your bootcamp, understanding you may not even be good or even like coding, and asking these bootcamps upfront how much job support they offer is essential in making this decision.

## How much can you realistically make after a bootcamp?

## How long did it take you to get a job after your bootcamp?

## What made you stand out as a bootcamp grad?

## What should I do to increase my chances of getting hired?
